 First, grab 1 extra-large potato, 2 large potatoes or 3 medium potatoes equalling about 315 grams. Rinse well in water and then peel the potato.
 Now slice the potato in slices having 1 cm thickness. Before slicing, you can remove the top and bottom part of the potato to get a square or rectangle shaped potato.
  Cut the potatoes in sticks having 1 cm width.
   Cut the remaining potato slices in sticks as well
   Rinse these potato sticks for a couple of times in water. Add the rinsed potatoes to a bowl and submerge them in cold water for 30-45 minutes to remove extra starch.
   and then fry them 
   eat then!
